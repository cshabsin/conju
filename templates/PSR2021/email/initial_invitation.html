  Summer Retreat at Purity Spring Resort: it's time to commit!
{{end}}

{{define "initial_invitation_text"}}Dear {{CollectiveAddressFirstNames .Invitation.InviteePeople 0}},

Vaccination rates are up, case counts are down, and we are feeling pretty
good about our decision to host our annual summer retreat at Purity Spring
Resort!  This year it will run from August 26th-29th, and you are invited
to spend the weekend with us relaxing and having fun, whatever that means
to you.  It seems likely that there will be fun people, board games,
swimming, dancing, jigsaw puzzles, hiking, crafting, campfires, and
beautiful scenery.  The rest is up to you!

If you can get vaccinated for COVID-19 and have chosen not to, we ask that 
you sit this year out. We're not sure yet what other precautions we'll take;
that will depend on how things look by then and the comfort level of the
people attending.

Our retreat will look somewhat different this year, mostly due to a web of
COVID-related ripple effects.  The main differences are:

 -- We'll be in	a different building (the ski lodge), which is significantly
    nicer, but correspondingly more expensive.  We'll also be using a
    different beach for swimming and boating.
 -- Purity Spring is doing food service again but it is also more expensive
    than we are used to.  We are still figuring out how to keep everyone fed
    for the weekend.
 -- The cost structure will be a little different (but simpler).

If you're coming, we will keep you updated (and probably need input from you!)
as we figure things out.

The cost per night per room (NOT per person) is ~$265.  So if you are staying
Friday and Saturday nights, the total (per room) will be ~$530.  If you choose
to also stay Thursday night, the total (per room) will be ~$795.

Note that these prices do not yet include any food.  Our food plan still a
work in progress.

If finances are the reason you're not coming, let us know.

Please let us know if you can join us. To RSVP, go to

  {{.LoginLink}}

If you're coming, we will almost certainly ask you for more information later.
But for now we need to start getting rooms reserved, so we'd appreciate it if
you could figure this out soon.

For more information on this weekend, as we figure it out ourselves, see:

We hope you can join us for our experimental pandemic summer retreat! It should
be a lot of fun and the company will be the best part.  We've missed you!

Chris, Dana, Lydia & Max
