  Summer Retreat at Purity Spring Resort: it's time to commit!
{{end}}

{{define "initial_invitation_text"}}Dear {{CollectiveAddressFirstNames .Invitation.InviteePeople 0}},

Vaccination rates are up, case counts are down, and we are feeling pretty
good about our decision to host our annual summer retreat at Purity Spring
Resort!  This year it will run from August 26th-29th, and you are invited
to spend the weekend with us relaxing and having fun, whatever that means to
you.  It seems likely that there will be fun people, board games, swimming,
dancing, jigsaw puzzles, hiking, crafting, campfires, and beautiful scenery.
The rest is up to you!

Note: If you can get vaccinated for COVID-19 and have chosen not to, we ask
that you sit this year out.

We're not sure yet what other precautions we'll take; that will depend on how
things look by then and the comfort level of the people attending.

Our retreat will look somewhat different this year, mostly due to a web of
COVID-related ripple effects.  The main differences are:

 -- We'll be in	a different building (the ski lodge), which is significantly
    nicer, but correspondingly more expensive.  We'll also be using a
    different beach for swimming and boating.
 -- Purity Spring is doing food service again but it is also more expensive
    than we are used to, so we aren't sure we'll go with that.  We are still
    figuring out how to keep everyone fed for the weekend.
 -- The cost structure will be a little different (but simpler).

If you're coming, we will keep you updated as we figure things out. Please
watch for further email from us, as we'll need your input.

This year, the cost is calculated per room, rather than per person as it
has been in the past. The cost per night per room is about $265, and you
have a choice between a two-night stay (Friday to Sunday, about $530), or
a three-night stay (Thursday to Sunday, about $795).

Note that these prices do not yet include any food.  Our food plan still a
work in progress; they only recently announced the return of food services.

If finances are the reason you're not coming, let us know.

Please let us know if you can join us. To RSVP, go to

We need to commit to the room reservation in a matter of days, so we would
appreciate a fast response.

For more information on this weekend, as we figure it out ourselves, see:

We hope you can join us for our experimental pandemic summer retreat! It should
be a lot of fun and the company will be the best part.  We've missed you!

Chris, Dana, Lydia & Max
