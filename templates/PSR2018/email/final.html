  Final Information for Purity Spring Retreat Weekend
{{end}}

{{define "final_text"}}Dear {{CollectiveAddressFirstNames .PeopleComing 0}},

Our summer weekend retreat is almost here! We're looking forward to seeing all of you up at Purity Spring.

Some last nuts and bolts:

Rides: If you need a ride to or from the weekend and don't have one yet, let us know ASAP (hit reply right now). If you are driving by yourself and you would prefer to have some company for the drive, let us know right now and we'll see what we can do.

  -- Passengers: You should have already received another email from us with your ride assignment.
  -- Drivers: if you have not already heard from us, we are not expecting you to take other passengers.

{{if .Thursday}}
Thursday Dinner: Thursday dinner will be at Traditions Restaurant in the Main Inn building (map: https://goo.gl/uhYkjK ) at 7.  If you know you'll be joining us, please let us know on your RSVP form in the blue box at the bottom: {{.LoginLink}}  Even if you didn't tell us to expect you, or you can't make it exactly at 7, there should still be plenty of room, so feel free to join us.
{{end}}
Friday Dinner: Friday dinner will be sandwiches and ice cream (and sorbet, don't worry, we haven't forsaken you, dairy-free people) and is intended to accommodate people arriving at different times. We will put out dinner around 6. If you have not already done so, please help us get an accurate count for dinner by filling out the form in the blue box at the bottom of your RSVP form ASAP ({{.LoginLink}})  We will have access to a refrigerator and a microwave, so feel free to sign up for dinner even if you will be arriving later.


Important Food Restrictions: Please be aware that no alcohol is permitted at this weekend. If you would like a drink sometime, alcohol is available in Traditions Restaurant in the Main Inn (map).

This section of the resort is a nut-free facility, so please don't bring any snacks with nuts.


Late Check-In: If you will be arriving after 11pm, the check in desk will be closed. Call Purity Spring (1-800-373-3754) before they close and let them know that you will be arriving late. You can either have the desk hold your key and leave it on the doorstep, or, if your deposit has been paid, we can pick it up for you and leave it outside your door. Please let us know if you're going to be arriving late (so we don't panic), and tell us if you need us to pick up your key.


Food: Purity Spring will provide breakfast (8-9:30), lunch (12:30) and dinner (6:00) on Saturday, and breakfast and lunch on Sunday, all in/next to Tecumseh Lodge. There will be vegetarian, dairy-free and gluten-free options at all meals. A microwave, fridge/freezer and electric kettle will be available in the common room in Osceola Lodge.

We're going to try something new this year! If it is easy for you, consider bringing a non-disposable plastic cup for every member of your family, clearly labeled with their name. If this is not completely trivial, don't worry, we'll still bring the red solo cups and the sharpies. It would just be nice to not have to check the name on 30 red solo cups before finding your own every time you want something to drink.


Communication with the Outside World: Cell signal is (at most) pretty flaky at PSR. Expect your phone to suck up a lot of battery if you leave it on. If you want to make sure that someone can reach you by phone in an emergency, give them Purity Spring's main number, 1-800-373-3754, and tell them that you are with the Scott/Shabsin party at The Lodges. All of the buildings have reasonably reliable wifi. If you really need to call out, find someone with a laptop and Google Voice (like Dana or Chris).


Directions: Purity Spring Resort is located at:

1251 Eaton Road (NH 153)
East Madison, NH 02849
1-800-373-3754
http://www.purityspring.com/

Because cell signal is so poor in the mountains, make sure you know where you are going before you leave home -- or at least before you leave more populated areas on your way up.

At least one person from each room will need to check in in the Millbrook building.  Coming from the south, it is one of the first buildings you will pass and it will be on your left. It is a large white house with red doors and there is a Purity Spring sign out front. If you pass Purity Lake on the right, you have gone too far. Park in the lot at Millbrook and check in.  If you are not traveling with your roommates, the first person to arrive can pick up all the keys if you like.

Once you have checked in, get back in your car and continue north on Eaton Road.

To get to our buildings, take the next left (past the lake on the right and immediately before the big open field on the left) onto East Madison Road. Tecumseh is on the right, the red building closest to the road after the field. All of our meals for will be served on the first floor of Tecumseh or just outside of it. Osceola is behind Tecumseh. Our main common room will be on the first floor of Osceola and our fire pit is behind it. Starr King is the long, low building across the road from Tecumseh/Osceola, on the left side of East Madison Road. Carrigain is about 100 yards up the road from Tecumseh/Osceola, on the right.

There is an EV charging outlet on the back side of Tecumseh (between Tecumseh and Osceola). We will clearly mark it. After 6pm on Friday, please do not park in this spot unless you have a fully-electric vehicle or have talked to the families that do (we can help you find them). If you have a plug-in hybrid there should be other outlets available.

All of the places you need to know about are marked on our map: https://goo.gl/uhYkjK


Other Resort-Related Miscellanea: Check in time is 3pm. Some rooms may be ready earlier. If you arrive before your room is ready, feel free to hang out in the common rooms or enjoy the resort amenities. We plan to arrive around 1 or 2 on Thursday.

Admission to the indoor pool, hot tub and fitness center are included in the cost for the weekend. These are located in The Mill (see map), approximately across the road from where you checked in.


What to Pack: Forecast is around 75F and with occasional clouds all weekend. Yay!

Please be aware that it is tick season. Be prepared! We will bring some bug spray and a tick remover and rubbing alcohol. Remember to check yourself and your children when you come in from outside.

We will have plenty of sunscreen and some insect repellant available for communal use. If you are traveling a long distance or don't intend to spend a lot of time outside you should be fine with our supply, but if you have a large family and/or intend to spend the weekend mostly outdoors you may wish to bring your own.

Please please please label anything that you intend for communal use with your name so that we can be sure it gets back to you.

Don't forget:

swimsuit
beach towel (PSR provides bath towels and pool towels)
sunscreen and bug spray unless you intend to use the communal supply
outdoor toys
games you want to play 
boots and appropriate clothes if you intend to hike
snacks if you would like food outside of set meal times
a flashlight if you expect to be outside after dark
chargers for any electronics you bring
a blanket for sitting outside
non-disposable cups
activities you think are fun!

Saturday evening: puzzle hunt
Sunday morning: archery range open
Sunday on the way home: Fun Spot Arcade
