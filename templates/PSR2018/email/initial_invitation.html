  Summer Retreat at Purity Spring Resort

Dear {{CollectiveAddressFirstNames .Invitation.InviteePeople 0}},





Six years ago, we invited some of our friends up into the mountains of New Hampshire to play board games, swim in the lake, swim in the pool, lounge in the hot tub, dance a lot, play Rock Band, [try to] climb the iceberg, build with LEGO, put together puzzles, solve puzzles, hike in the White Mountains, play on the playground, toast marshmallows around the bonfire, visit Storyland, sit in a beautiful place and do crafts, visit with old friends, meet new friends, and, coincidentally, watch us and support us as we got married.

The past few years, we've done the same thing, only we skipped the part where we got married, and that was way less stressful. We got Purity Spring Resort to help us try fun things like archery and rock climbing. Our amazing friends, who know all about things like model rocketry, juggling, handbell ringing, role-playing games, and chocolatiering shared their hobbies with anyone who was interested. It's been awesome. So we're doing it again! We'd love it if you could join us for a weekend of relaxation and fun, whatever that means to you.

We will be hosting a weekend of mostly-unstructured fun at Purity Spring Resort in East Madison, NH, over the weekend of June 7th-10th, 2018.  The cost for the weekend will range from $120-$165 per person, depending on how many people stay in your room. If you'd like to extend your weekend away, some people will be staying Thursday night as well. The extra night will cost an additional $35-$60 per person, again depending on the number of people in your room.

Please let us know if you can join us. To RSVP, go to

The RSVP form got long.  It should still be pretty quick to fill out, and you can go back and add more information as many times as you need to.  Also, know that everything on the form is something we've had to send a lot of email about in the past, and we'd like to cut down on the back and forth.

For more information on this weekend, including the cost per person and what it covers, see: http://psr2018.shabsin.com


We hope you can join us for our weekend retreat! It should be a lot of fun and the company will be the best part.


Chris, Dana & Lydia
