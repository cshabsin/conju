      <p> Eleven years ago we invited some of our friends and family up into the mountains of New Hampshire to hang out
        for the weekend while we got married. We had so much fun that we're doing it again and skipping the wedding
        part!

	This year our retreat will run from Thursday, June 8th until Sunday, June 11th. Most structured activities
        will happen between Friday evening and Sunday night. We expect that there will be a small group Thursday night
	and many more people around Friday - Sunday.
      </p>

      <p>
	Our goal is to provide a framework for you to have the kind of weekend that would be most fun for you, whether
        that means hiking and swimming, playing board games and doing jigsaw puzzles, or sitting in a quiet pretty place
        with a book. If you would like to run an activity, let us know if there is any support you need from us or from
        Purity Spring.
      </p>
