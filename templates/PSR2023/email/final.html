  Final Information for Purity Spring Retreat Weekend
{{end}}

{{define "final_text"}}Dear {{CollectiveAddressFirstNames .Invitation.GetPeopleComing 0}},

Our summer weekend retreat is almost here! We're looking forward to seeing all of you up at Purity
Spring.

TL;DR: Sorry, you actually have to read all of this one, even if you've attended before.

Rides: If you need a ride to or from the weekend and don't have one yet, let us know ASAP (hit 
reply right now).

  -- Passengers: You should have already received another email from us with your ride assignment.
  -- Drivers: if you have not already heard from us, we are not expecting you to take other
              passengers.


COVID: Please take a COVID test before you get in the car to drive to New Hampshire.

We ask that people who test positive for COVID-19 stay home.  If you need to cancel, let us know as
soon as you can.

Please have everyone in your party take a rapid test before leaving your room each morning.  If you
have a positive test result, let us know immediately and we will help you figure out what to do.  If
you can bring your own tests please do so; if you can't manage that, we'll have some extras.

Masks are not required in our two main common spaces, Osceola & Tecumseh.  Masks ARE required in
Carrigain Lodge.  Respect others' masking choices and ask before getting too close, giving hugs,
etc.  We will bring some extra KN95 masks in adult and kid sizes in case anyone wants one.

There are picnic tables just outside Tecumseh, across the parking lot, so people can eat outdoors if
desired.  There aren't a lot of places to sit outside near our main common room so if you'd prefer
to socialize outside you might want to bring a blanket or camp chair. The forecast does look a
little rainy and chilly for this time of year, so plan accordingly.

We're designating the first 15 minutes of meal times as a mask-required time, to allow people who
are taking more COVID precautions to get their food.  If you are in the food service room at this
time, please wear a mask or step out of the room until everyone taking precautions is done getting
their food.  If you would like to get your meals during these periods, please let us know either
privately, or by selecting the relevant role in the Discord.  Also, please let us know if you are
going to miss a meal.  This way we will know when we can open meals for everyone.


Directions: Purity Spring Resort is located at:

1256 Eaton Road (NH 153)
East Madison, NH 02849
603-367-8896
http://www.purityspring.com/

Because cell signal is so poor in the mountains, make sure you know where you are going before you
leave home, or at least before you leave more populated areas on your way up.

When you arrive: At least one person from each room will need to check in in The Mill. Coming from
the south, it is one of the first buildings you will pass and it will be on your right. It is a
gray building with lots of windows and there is a sign that says "The Mill" out front. If you pass
Purity Lake on the right, you have gone too far. Park in the lot and check in. If you are not
traveling with your roommates, the first person to arrive can pick up all the keys if you like (but
you should probably work this out in advance).

{{template "roomingInfo_text" .RoomingInfo}}

Once you have checked in, get back in your car and continue north on Eaton Road.

{{if .RoomingInfo.InviteeBookings.IsKingPine}}
If you want to go to the common areas with people/meals/games first, take the next left (past the
lake on the right and immediately before the big open field on the left) onto East Madison Road.
Tecumseh is on the right, the red building closest to the road after the field. Osceola is behind
Tecumseh. Our main common room will be on the first floor of Osceola and our fire pit is behind it.
Carrigain is about 100 yards up the road from Tecumseh/Osceola, on the right.

If you want to go to your room first, King Pine Lodge is about half a mile north of the Mill. It is
a long, low building on the left and there is a sign out front that reads "Purity Spring Resort /
King Pine / Guest Rooms / Trailsend Tavern / Evergreen Room."  Our rooms are in the south half
(closer to The Mill).
{{else}}
To get to our buildings, take the next left (past the lake on the right and immediately before the
big open field on the left) onto East Madison Road. Tecumseh is on the right, the red building
closest to the road after the field. Osceola is behind Tecumseh. Our main common room will be on the
first floor of Osceola and our fire pit is behind it.  Carrigain is about 100 yards up the road from
Tecumseh/Osceola, on the right.  There are also people staying in King Pine Lodge, a little farther
north up Eaton Road.
{{end}}

There are EV charging outlets on the back side of Tecumseh (between Tecumseh and Osceola), behind
King Pine, and next to the restaurant (near where you checked in).  We will clearly mark them.
Please do not park in these spots unless you are actively charging.  Make sure you bring any cables
you need to charge, since they only provide an outlet.

All of the places you need to know about are marked on our map (http://tinyurl.com/psr2023-map).

If you're looking for company/food/games/us, go to the Osceola common room.


Late Check-In: If you will be arriving after 9pm, the check in desk will be closed. Call Purity
Spring (603-367-8896) before they close and let them know that you will be arriving late. You can
either have the desk hold your key and leave it in the mailbox to the right of the door of The Mill,
or we can pick it up for you and hold it in the common room. Please let us know if you're going to
be arriving late (so we don't panic), and tell us if you need us to pick up your key.


Food:

{{if .Invitation.Thursday}}
Thursday Dinner: We will be arriving Thursday afternoon and will be getting dinner from the on-site
restaurant at Purity Spring.  We have a private room in the restaurant reserved from 6-8.  The
screened porch is also available.  In order to make the staff's lives easier we will have everyone
order as they arrive and not attempt to eat simultaneously.

Friday lunch will be sandwiches served in the Osceola common room.

{{end}}

Friday dinner will be "pizza plus" from a local restaurant.  Sign up on the "Friday Pizza Dinner"
tab of the logistics spreadsheet (https://tinyurl.com/psr2023-logistics) by noon on Friday.  If you
need to add/remove something after that, contact us directly.

Saturday lunch will be served by the resort, out in front of the Tecumseh lodge, unless weather
forces us to eat inside. Saturday dinner and Sunday lunch will be served by the resort in the
Tecumseh common room.

For group meals we will let those who need extra COVID precautions serve themselves first.
Please leave the room or stay masked during this time.

We will aim to have lunch available for the COVID cautious at 11:45, opening up for everyone at 12,
and dinner at 5:45 and 6.

In an attempt to keep the cost of the weekend down, we have not included breakfast this year.
You will need to arrange for your own breakfast.  There are a few options here.

The restaurant at the resort serves breakfast for takeout from 7-11am:
https://tinyurl.com/psr2023-breakfast

You are also welcome to bring your own food, but fridge space is limited. Rooms in King Pine ONLY
have a minifridge, microwave, and coffeemaker.  Carrigain has its own kitchen, and there is a
full (but not large) kitchen off the Osceola common room.

There is a "Snacks" tab on the logistics spreadsheet if you would like to coordinate/share:
https://tinyurl.com/psr2023-breakfast  We will bring stickers to put on any food you're willing
to share.  Do not eat food in the fridge that's not yours and doesn't have a sticker.

If you cook, please clean up after yourself promptly.  If you notice that the dishwasher is full,
please run it.  If you notice that the dishwasher is clean, please empty it.

If it is easy for you, consider bringing a reusable cup for every member of your family, clearly
labeled with their name.  If this is not completely trivial, don't worry, we'll still bring the red
solo cups and the sharpies.

Please be aware that no outside alcohol is permitted at this weekend.  If you would like a drink
sometime, alcohol is available in Traditions Restaurant in the Main Inn
(http://tinyurl.com/psr2022-map).

We also have someone in our party with a severe airbone allergy to walnuts and ginger, so please
do not bring food with these ingredients into the common rooms.



Communication: We have a Discord server!  We will be using it to make announcements/coordinate
activities throughout the weekend.  Get connected: {{.Env.DISCORD_URL}}

Once you're there, change your display name to something you'd put on a nametag.  Then head to the
#i-am-going channel to join the 2023 group, set your pronouns, and sign up to be notified when
various fun or useful things are happening.

This is not required and you are free to eschew technology for the weekend. :)


What to Pack: The forecast is sporadically rainy with temperatures in the 60s during the day/high
40s during the night Thursday - Saturday, and sunny and warmer Sunday.

There is an indoor pool and hot tub, and a lake, so there are plenty of opportunities for swimming.
PSR provides bath towels and pool towels, but not beach towels.

You'll need to bring whatever you need to feed yourself breakfast (see above).

If you are staying in King Pine you might want to bring a flashlight to make the walk back and forth
easier after dark.

The resort has moved to electronic room keys that are also required to get into the common spaces.
If you have children who can have some independence but will have trouble handling a key, plan ahead
(for example, we're going to give Lydia a lanyard that can hold a key).

If it's easy for you, please bring a checkbook to pay us at the end of the weekend. A lot of money
needs to change hands and Venmo/Paypal/Google Pay all have conditions and limits. Sorry!

Also if it's easy, bring a non-breakable, distinct-looking cup, clearly labeled with your name.

We will have plenty of sunscreen and some insect repellant available for communal use. If you are
traveling a long distance or don't intend to spend a lot of time outside you should be fine with our
supply, but if you have a large family and/or intend to spend the weekend mostly outdoors you may
wish to bring your own.

There will probably be lots of ticks.  Remember to check yourself and your children when you come in
from outside.  We'll bring tweezers and rubbing alcohol.

What will help you have fun this weekend?  Anything you want to share?  Games, jigsaw puzzles,
outdoor activities, your knitting, a good book or three?  There's a tab for games on the
spreadsheet (https://tinyurl.com/psr2023-logistics).

Please please please label anything that you intend for communal use with your name so that we can
be sure it gets back to you.


Checkout: We need to be out of our rooms by 11 on Sunday, and will lose access to the common rooms
at noon (this means getting all of our stuff out by then).  Since we're being served lunch in the
Tecumseh dining room on Sunday, we will continue to have access there for the meal, but when the
meal is over, we need to get out.



As always, you can find more information about our event, or change your profile information or
rsvp, on our event website: {{.LoginLink}}

If you have any questions or concerns, please let us know. We can't wait to see you all in just
a few days!



Dana, Chris, Lydia and Max

<p>Dear {{CollectiveAddressFirstNames .Invitation.GetPeopleComing 0}},<p>

<p>Our summer weekend retreat is almost here!  We're looking forward to seeing all of you up at Purity Spring.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Sorry, you have to actually read this one, especially the COVID section.</p>

<h3>Rides</h3>
<p>If you need a ride to or from the weekend and don't have one yet, let us know ASAP (hit reply right now).</p>

<p>
Passengers: You should have already received another email from us with your ride assignment.<br>
Drivers: if you have not already heard from us, we are not expecting you to take other passengers.
</p>

{{if .Invitation.Thursday}}
<h3>Thursday Dinner</h3>
<p>We will be arriving Thursday afternoon and will be getting dinner from the <a href="https://www.purityspring.com/dining/traditions-restaurant-pub/">on-site restaurant</a> at Purity Spring, probably around 6:30.
If the weather is good, we will get takeout and eat at the picnic tables on the island across the road.  If it's raining, PSR will reserve a private room in the restaurant for us.
You are welcome to join us, either with food from the restaurant or with food you bring yourself.  The forecast is predicting rain for the evening, so
we're likely to end up eating indoors.  Plan accordingly.</p>
{{end}}

<h3>COVID-19</h3>

<p>Please take a COVID test before you get in the car to drive to New Hampshire.</p>

<p>We ask that people who test positive for COVID-19 on a rapid antigen test stay home.  Note that
while PCR or Cue tests can give positive results long after a COVID case has cleared, we believe
a rapid antigen test has a pretty good correlation to infectiousness. If you need to cancel, let us
know as soon as you can.</p>

<p>Please have everyone in your party take a rapid test before leaving your room each morning.  If you
have a positive test result, let us know immediately and we will help you figure out what to do.  If
you can bring your own tests please do so; if you can't manage that, we'll have some extras.</p>

<p>Please remain masked in the Osceola common room and kitchen, except when actively eating or 
drinking (though eating elsewhere is encouraged). In the Tecumseh common spaces, masks are optional.
Respect others' masking choices and ask before getting too close, giving hugs, etc. We will bring
some extra KN95 masks in adult and kid sizes in case anyone wants one.</p>

<p>There are picnic tables just outside Tecumseh, across the parking lot, so people can eat outdoors if
desired.  There aren't a lot of places to sit outside near our main common room so if you'd prefer
to socialize outside you might want to bring a blanket or camp chair. The forecast does look a tad
rainy.</p>

<p>Everyone in our party is vaccinated/boosted to the extent that they can be, which means that
everyone except Lydia and Max has been vaccinated.</p>

<h3>Late Check-In</h3>
<p>If you will be arriving after 9pm, the check in desk will be closed. Call Purity Spring (603-367-8896) before they close and let them know that you will be arriving late.
You can either have the desk hold your key and leave it in the mailbox to the right of the door of The Mill, or we can pick it up for you and hold it in the common room.
Please let us know if you're going to be arriving late (so we don't panic), and tell us if you need us to pick up your key.
</p>

<h3>Food</h3>
<p>All meals other than Thursday dinner will take place near/be delivered to the Osceola common room.</p>

<p>We have arranged for Friday, Saturday and Sunday lunch and Friday and Saturday dinner from various local restaurants.  Thank you for signing up promptly for food.  All of the orders have now been submitted.  If you would like to add something to a particular order, let us know by email (rather than the spreadsheet) as soon as possible.  We cannot guarantee that we will be able to add on your orders.</p>

<p>For any meal you're not participating in a group order, there is a limited takeout menu from the on-site restaurant. In a pinch, there are plenty of other restaurants nearby.</p>

<p>You are also welcome to bring your own food, but fridge space is limited. Rooms in King Pine ONLY have a
minifridge, microwave, and coffeemaker.  Carrigain has its own kitchen, and there is a (new! shiny!)
full (but not large) kitchen off the Osceola common room.  If you cook, please clean up after yourself promptly.</p>

<p>People also often bring snacks to share.</p>

<p>If it is easy for you, consider bringing a reusable cup for every member of your family, clearly labeled with their name. If this is not completely trivial, don't worry, we'll still bring the red solo cups and the sharpies. But this seems like a good year to not accidentally drink out of someone else's cup.</p>

<h3>Communication with the Outside World</h3>
<p>Cell signal is (at most) pretty flaky at PSR.  Expect your phone to suck up a lot of battery if you leave it on.  If you want to make sure that someone can reach you by phone in an emergency, give them Purity Spring's main number, 1-800-373-3754, and tell them that you are with the Scott/Shabsin party at the Lodges.  All of the buildings have reasonably reliable wifi.  If you really need to call out, find someone with Google Voice (like Dana or Chris).<p>


<h3>What to Pack</h3>
<p>Forecast is rainy Thursday night, and sporadically rainy Friday through Sunday, with temperatures in the 70s during the day, lows in the 50s at night.</p>

<p>There is an indoor pool and hot tub, and a lake, so there are plenty of opportunities for swimming.
PSR provides bath towels and pool towels, but not beach towels.</p>

<p>We will have plenty of sunscreen and some insect repellant available for communal use. If you are
traveling a long distance or don't intend to spend a lot of time outside you should be fine with our
supply, but if you have a large family and/or intend to spend the weekend mostly outdoors you may

from outside.  We'll bring tweezers and rubbing alcohol.</p>

<p>If you are staying in King Pine you might want to bring a flashlight to make the walk back and forth
easier after dark.</p>

<p>If there is any food you are particularly picky about (e.g. coffee) you may wish to bring your own.
If you/your family is skipping some of the pre-arranged meals, you'll probably want to bring
something else to eat. </p>

<p>If it's easy for you, please bring a checkbook to pay your share of group meals. A lot of money needs to change hands and Venmo/Paypal/Google Pay all have conditions and limits. Sorry!</p>

<p>Also if it's easy, bring a non-breakable, distinct-looking cup, clearly labeled with your name.</p>

<p>What will help you have fun this weekend?  Anything you want to share?  Games, jigsaw puzzles,
outdoor activities, your knitting, a good book or three?  There's a tab for games on the
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/psr2022-help">spreadsheet</a>.</p>
