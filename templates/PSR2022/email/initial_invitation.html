  Summer Retreat at Purity Spring Resort, June 9th-12th: it's time to commit!
{{end}}

{{define "initial_invitation_text"}}Dear {{CollectiveAddressFirstNames .Invitation.InviteePeople 0}},

Yes, it's happening!  We are hosting our annual retreat at Purity
Spring Resort in East Madison, NH!  This year it will run from June
9th-12th, and you are invited to spend the weekend with us relaxing
and having fun, whatever that means to you.  It seems likely that
there will be fun people, board games, swimming, dancing, jigsaw
puzzles, hiking, crafting, campfires, and beautiful scenery.  The rest
is up to you!

You can join us for Friday - Sunday or come up Thursday instead for an
extra day of vacation.  Most structured activities (such as they are)
will happen between Friday night and Sunday afternoon.

If you can get vaccinated for COVID-19 and have chosen not to, we ask
that you sit this year out.  We're not sure yet what other COVID
precautions we'll take; that will depend on how things look by then
and the comfort level of the people attending.

This year, the cost for the weekend is calculated per room, rather
than per person as it has been in the past.  We have a range of rooms
available.  Some are cheaper, some are nicer, some are farther from
the middle of things.  Rooms will cost $130-$260/night, depending on
which buildings they're in and how many people they hold.

Note that these prices do not yet include any food.  Full disclosure:
we have no idea yet how we're going to feed you all and how much it's
going to cost -- the buffet-style meals the resort provides have
gotten more expensive, so it might not be the right choice for us
anymore.  But we will try to keep costs as low, or as a la carte, as
we can manage.

If finances are the reason you're not coming, let us know.

If you're coming, we will keep you updated as we figure things
out. Please watch for further email from us, as we'll need your input.

Please let us know if you can join us. To RSVP, go to

We hope you can join us for our second pandemic summer retreat! It
should be a lot of fun and the company will be the best part.  We've
missed you!

Chris, Dana, Lydia & Max
